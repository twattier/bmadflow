## Dev Notes

### Database Configuration

**Image Selection**: Use `ankane/pgvector:latest` Docker image which includes PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension pre-installed.

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#database-section]

**pgvector Extension**: Required for vector similarity search with 768-dimensional embeddings from `nomic-embed-text` model. Vector dimension is fixed at 768 and cannot be changed without recreating tables.

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#chunks-table]

### Docker Compose Service Definitions

**PostgreSQL Service**:
```yaml
db:
  image: ankane/pgvector:latest
  container_name: bmadflow-db
  environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER:-bmadflow}
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-changeme}
    POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB:-bmadflow}
  ports:
    - "${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}:5432"
  volumes:
    - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER:-bmadflow}"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
  networks:
    - bmadflow-network
```

[Source: architecture/deployment.md#docker-compose-configuration]

**pgAdmin Service**:
```yaml
pgadmin:
  image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
  container_name: bmadflow-pgadmin
  environment:
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@bmadflow.local
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: admin
    PGADMIN_CONFIG_SERVER_MODE: 'False'  # No auth for POC
    PGADMIN_CONFIG_MASTER_PASSWORD_REQUIRED: 'False'
  ports:
    - "${PGADMIN_PORT:-5050}:80"
  depends_on:
    - db
  networks:
    - bmadflow-network
```

[Source: architecture/deployment.md#docker-compose-configuration]

### Environment Variables

Required `.env.example` contents:
```bash
# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_USER=bmadflow
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme_in_production
POSTGRES_DB=bmadflow
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://bmadflow:changeme_in_production@localhost:5432/bmadflow

# Port Configuration (adjust if conflicts exist)
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
PGADMIN_PORT=5050
```

[Source: architecture/deployment.md#environment-variables]

**Port Configurability**: All service ports are configurable via .env to avoid conflicts on developer machines. Use `${PORT:-default}` syntax for environment variable support with fallback defaults.

[Source: architecture/deployment.md#port-configuration]

### Data Persistence

**Named Volume**: `postgres_data` volume persists database data across container restarts. Data survives `docker-compose down` but NOT `docker-compose down -v` (volume deletion).

**Backup Command**:
```bash
docker exec bmadflow-db pg_dump -U bmadflow bmadflow > backup.sql
```

**Restore Command**:
```bash
docker exec -i bmadflow-db psql -U bmadflow bmadflow < backup.sql
```

[Source: architecture/deployment.md#data-persistence]

### Security Considerations (POC-Specific)

⚠️ **Acceptable for POC only** (localhost deployment):
- No pgAdmin authentication (`SERVER_MODE: False`)
- Simple database password in .env file
- HTTP-only communication (no TLS)
- Port exposure to localhost only

**Production would require**: API authentication, HTTPS/TLS, secrets management, network security.

[Source: architecture/deployment.md#security-considerations]

### Verification Steps

**1. Check Service Health**:
```bash
docker-compose ps
# Expected: bmadflow-db shows "Up (healthy)"
```

**2. Verify pgvector Extension**:
```bash
docker exec bmadflow-db psql -U bmadflow -d bmadflow -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
docker exec bmadflow-db psql -U bmadflow -d bmadflow -c "SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';"
# Expected: Row returned showing vector extension
```

**3. Test pgAdmin Access**:
- Navigate to http://localhost:5050
- Add server: Host=db, Port=5432, Username=bmadflow, Password=changeme
- Verify connection successful

[Source: architecture/deployment.md#deployment-steps]

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

**Integration Testing**:
- Verify PostgreSQL container starts and becomes healthy
- Verify pgvector extension is available
- Verify pgAdmin can connect to database
- Verify data persistence across container restarts

**No Unit Tests Required**: This is infrastructure setup.

**Manual Testing**:
```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify health
docker-compose ps

# Test pgvector
docker exec bmadflow-db psql -U bmadflow -d bmadflow -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"

# Test persistence
docker exec bmadflow-db psql -U bmadflow -d bmadflow -c "CREATE TABLE test_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);"
docker exec bmadflow-db psql -U bmadflow -d bmadflow -c "INSERT INTO test_table (name) VALUES ('test');"
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker exec bmadflow-db psql -U bmadflow -d bmadflow -c "SELECT * FROM test_table;"
# Expected: test row returned
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT**

This infrastructure setup story demonstrates high-quality implementation with comprehensive verification testing. The developer properly handled runtime issues (port conflicts, email validation) and documented all adaptations. Configuration follows Docker Compose best practices with proper health checks, named volumes, and environment variable support.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive manual testing performed and documented
- All acceptance criteria met with evidence
- Adaptive problem-solving (port conflicts, email format)
- Clear documentation in README with step-by-step instructions
- Proper use of environment variables with fallback defaults

### Refactoring Performed

Three quality improvements applied to enhance maintainability and developer experience:

- **File**: `docker-compose.yml`
  - **Change**: Removed obsolete `version: '3.8'` declaration
  - **Why**: Docker Compose v2+ automatically determines version; explicit version causes warnings in logs
  - **How**: Cleaner output, follows modern Docker Compose conventions

- **File**: `.env.example`
  - **Change**: Restructured to use variable references in DATABASE_URL and added guidance comment
  - **Why**: Original had hardcoded port 5432 in DATABASE_URL; inconsistent with POSTGRES_PORT variable
  - **How**: Changed to `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@localhost:${POSTGRES_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}` with comment explaining port adjustment strategy
  - **Impact**: Prevents new developer confusion when port conflicts require non-default ports

- **File**: `README.md`
  - **Change**: Updated pgAdmin password documentation from `changeme` to `changeme_in_production`
  - **Why**: Mismatch between README and actual `.env.example` value
  - **How**: Updated documentation to match configuration files

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS - Infrastructure configuration follows YAML best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✓ PASS - Files placed in correct locations (root for docker-compose, .env.example)
