# Story 3.1: Build File Tree API for Document Hierarchy

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to retrieve a hierarchical file tree structure from synced documents,
**so that** I can display it in the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. REST API endpoint `GET /api/projects/{id}/file-tree` returns hierarchical JSON structure
2. File tree structure includes: folders (nested), files (with metadata: id, name, path, type, size)
3. Tree built from documents table file_path field, parsing directory structure
4. Files grouped by ProjectDoc if multiple ProjectDocs exist in Project
5. Tree sorted: folders first (alphabetical), then files (alphabetical)
6. Unit tests for tree-building logic
7. Integration test: sync repo with nested folders, verify correct tree structure returned

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create File Tree Data Structures** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `FileTreeNode` Pydantic response schema in `app/schemas/document.py`
    - Add fields: `type` (folder|file), `name`, `path`, `children` (optional), `id` (for files), `file_type`, `size`
    - Recursive structure: folder nodes contain children list
  - [x] Create `FileTreeResponse` Pydantic schema
    - Add fields: `project_id`, `tree` (List[FileTreeNode])

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Tree-Building Service Logic** (AC: 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Create `build_file_tree()` method in `app/services/document_service.py`
    - Query all documents for project via `document_repository.list_by_project_id(project_id)`
    - Parse `file_path` field to build hierarchical structure
    - Group files by `project_doc_id` as root-level folders (if multiple ProjectDocs)
    - Sort folders alphabetically, then files alphabetically within each folder
    - Return nested dictionary structure
  - [x] Add helper function `_parse_path_to_tree()` to build tree from flat file paths
    - Use recursive dictionary structure: `{folder_name: {children: {}, files: []}}`
  - [x] Convert dictionary structure to `FileTreeNode` list

- [x] **Task 3: Create File Tree API Endpoint** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add route `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/file-tree` in `app/api/v1/documents.py`
  - [x] Inject `DocumentService` via dependency injection
  - [x] Call `document_service.build_file_tree(project_id)`
  - [x] Return `FileTreeResponse` with status 200
  - [x] Handle errors: return 404 if project not found, 500 for server errors

- [x] **Task 4: Write Unit Tests for Tree-Building Logic** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Create `backend/tests/unit/services/test_document_service.py`
  - [x] Test `build_file_tree()` with sample flat file paths
    - Test case: Single-level files (no folders)
    - Test case: Nested folders (2-3 levels deep)
    - Test case: Multiple ProjectDocs (ensure grouped correctly)
    - Test case: Empty project (no documents)
  - [x] Test sorting: verify folders come before files, all alphabetically sorted
  - [x] Run tests: `cd backend && pytest tests/unit/services/test_document_service.py -v`

- [x] **Task 5: Write Integration Test for File Tree API** (AC: 7)
  - [x] Create `backend/tests/integration/api/test_file_tree_api.py`
  - [x] Test scenario: Create project, create ProjectDoc, sync documents with nested structure
    - Mock document repository to return sample documents with file paths like:
      - `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/prd.md`, `docs/architecture/backend.md`
    - Call `GET /api/projects/{id}/file-tree`
    - Assert response status 200
    - Assert tree structure matches expected hierarchy
    - Verify folders and files sorted correctly
  - [x] Test error cases: Project not found (404), no documents synced (empty tree)
  - [x] Run tests: `cd backend && pytest tests/integration/api/test_file_tree_api.py -v`

- [x] **Task 6: Code Quality and Formatting** (AC: All)
  - [x] Format code: `cd backend && black app/ tests/`
  - [x] Lint code: `cd backend && ruff check app/ tests/ --fix`

  - [x] Verify no hardcoded values (use constants for defaults)
  - [x] Review error handling and add appropriate log statements

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.7 Dev Agent Record:
- **Documents Table Populated**: Story 2.4 implemented document download and storage. The `documents` table contains `file_path` field with relative paths from GitHub repos (e.g., `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/prd/epic-1.md`)
- **Multiple ProjectDocs Support**: Projects can have multiple ProjectDocs, each representing a different GitHub repository or folder path
- **Async FastAPI Patterns**: Use async route handlers with `AsyncSession` dependency injection (established pattern from Epic 2)
- **Repository Pattern**: Use `document_repository.list_by_project_id()` to fetch all documents for a project
- **Error Handling**: Use FastAPI `HTTPException` with appropriate status codes (404 for not found, 500 for server errors)

**Data Models - Document** [Source: [docs/architecture/data-models.md](../architecture/data-models.md)]

SQLAlchemy Document Model:
```python
class Document(Base):
    __tablename__ = "documents"

    id: Mapped[uuid.UUID]
    project_doc_id: Mapped[uuid.UUID]  # Foreign key to ProjectDoc
    file_path: Mapped[str]             # Relative path (e.g., "docs/architecture.md")
    file_type: Mapped[str]             # File extension (md, csv, yaml, json)
    file_size: Mapped[int]             # File size in bytes
    content: Mapped[str]               # Full file content
    metadata: Mapped[dict | None]     # JSONB metadata
    created_at: Mapped[datetime]
    updated_at: Mapped[datetime]

    # Relationships
    project_doc: Mapped["ProjectDoc"] = relationship(back_populates="documents")
```

**API Specification** [Source: [docs/architecture/api-specification.md](../architecture/api-specification.md)]

Endpoint to implement:
```
GET /api/projects/{id}/file-tree
```

Response format (200 OK):
```json
{
  "project_id": "uuid",
  "tree": [
    {
      "type": "folder",
      "name": "docs",
      "path": "docs",
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "file",
          "id": "uuid",
          "name": "architecture.md",
          "path": "docs/architecture.md",
          "file_type": "md",
          "size": 45000
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**File Tree Building Algorithm** [Source: [docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md](../architecture/backend-architecture.md#file-tree-algorithm)]

Tree-building strategy:
1. Fetch all documents for project (via `document_repository.list_by_project_id()`)
2. If multiple ProjectDocs exist, create root-level folder nodes for each ProjectDoc
3. Parse `file_path` field to extract folder hierarchy (split by `/`)
4. Build recursive dictionary structure: `{folder_name: {children: {}, files: []}}`
5. Convert dictionary to nested `FileTreeNode` Pydantic models
6. Sort at each level: folders first (alphabetical), then files (alphabetical)

**Project Structure** [Source: [docs/architecture/source-tree.md](../architecture/source-tree.md)]

File locations for new code:
- API Route: `backend/app/api/v1/documents.py`
- Service Layer: `backend/app/services/document_service.py`
- Schemas: `backend/app/schemas/document.py`
- Unit Tests: `backend/tests/unit/services/test_document_service.py`
- Integration Tests: `backend/tests/integration/api/test_file_tree_api.py`

Import path alias: Absolute imports from `app` root (e.g., `from app.services.document_service import DocumentService`)

**Database Schema** [Source: [docs/architecture/database-schema.md](../architecture/database-schema.md)]

Relevant tables:
- **documents**: Contains `file_path` field (VARCHAR 1024) with relative paths
- **project_docs**: Parent table for documents (via `project_doc_id` foreign key)
- **projects**: Top-level container (via `project_id` in project_docs)

Query pattern to fetch documents for a project:
```python
async def list_by_project_id(project_id: UUID) -> List[Document]:
    """Fetch all documents for a project (across all ProjectDocs)."""
    query = (
        select(Document)
        .join(ProjectDoc, Document.project_doc_id == ProjectDoc.id)
        .where(ProjectDoc.project_id == project_id)
        .options(joinedload(Document.project_doc))  # Eager load ProjectDoc for grouping
    )
    result = await db.execute(query)
    return result.scalars().all()
```

**FastAPI Patterns** [Source: [docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md](../architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-layer)]

Route handler pattern:
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from app.schemas.document import FileTreeResponse
from app.services.document_service import DocumentService
from app.api.deps import get_document_service
from uuid import UUID

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/projects/{project_id}/file-tree", response_model=FileTreeResponse)
async def get_file_tree(
    project_id: UUID,
    document_service: DocumentService = Depends(get_document_service)
):
    """Get hierarchical file tree for project documents."""
    try:
        tree = await document_service.build_file_tree(project_id)
        return tree
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Failed to build file tree: {str(e)}")
```

### Testing

**Testing Strategy** [Source: [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md](../architecture/testing-strategy.md)]

Backend Testing Requirements:
1. **Unit Tests (pytest)**:
   - Location: `backend/tests/unit/services/`
   - Test service logic in isolation with mocked repositories
   - Mock `document_repository.list_by_project_id()` to return sample documents
   - Test edge cases: empty project, single file, nested folders, multiple ProjectDocs
   - Run: `cd backend && pytest tests/unit -v --cov=app`

2. **Integration Tests (pytest)**:
   - Location: `backend/tests/integration/api/`
   - Test full API endpoint with real database (test database)
   - Use pytest fixtures to create test projects, ProjectDocs, and documents
   - Test HTTP requests using `httpx.AsyncClient`
   - Verify response status codes and JSON structure
   - Run: `cd backend && pytest tests/integration -v`

3. **Test Coverage Target**: 70%+ for service layer logic (per NFR18)

**Testing Patterns**:
```python
# Unit test example
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_build_file_tree_nested_folders(mock_document_repo):
    # Arrange
    mock_documents = [
        Mock(id=UUID("..."), file_path="docs/architecture.md", file_type="md", file_size=1000),
        Mock(id=UUID("..."), file_path="docs/prd/epic-1.md", file_type="md", file_size=2000),
    ]
    mock_document_repo.list_by_project_id = AsyncMock(return_value=mock_documents)
    service = DocumentService(document_repo=mock_document_repo)

    # Act
    result = await service.build_file_tree(UUID("project-id"))

    # Assert
    assert len(result.tree) == 1  # One root folder: "docs"
    assert result.tree[0].type == "folder"
    assert result.tree[0].name == "docs"
    assert len(result.tree[0].children) == 2  # "architecture.md" and "prd" folder
```

**Code Quality Standards** [Source: [docs/architecture/coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md)]

Backend:
- **Formatting**: Black (line length 100) - Run: `black app/ tests/`
- **Linting**: Ruff - Run: `ruff check app/ tests/ --fix`
- **Type Hints**: Required for all functions (use `List`, `Dict`, `Optional` from `typing`)
- **Docstrings**: Google Style for public functions
- **Async/Await**: Use async for all I/O operations (database queries, API calls)
- **Error Handling**: Use FastAPI `HTTPException` with appropriate status codes
- **Logging**: Use structured logging (`logger.info`, `logger.error`) for important operations
