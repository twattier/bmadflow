# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: Epic 1
**Epic Name**: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All 6 stories Done (100% complete)
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-07
**Priority**: Critical (Foundation)

## Epic Goal

Establish the foundational project structure, containerized services, database with migrations, basic REST API scaffolding, and a simple frontend landing page. This epic validates the complete development workflow and deployment pipeline end-to-end while delivering a testable "Hello BMADFlow" application.

## Epic Description

This epic creates the complete technical foundation that all subsequent epics will build upon. By the end of this epic, developers will have:

- A working monorepo with frontend and backend directories
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension running in Docker
- FastAPI backend with Alembic migrations and OpenAPI documentation
- React frontend with shadcn/ui Dashboard template and Tailwind CSS
- Docker Compose orchestration supporting both Full Docker and Hybrid deployment modes
- End-to-end integration validated with a "Hello BMADFlow" application

**Success Criteria** ✅:
- ✅ User can run `docker-compose up` and see "Hello BMADFlow" message in browser at `http://localhost:3002`
- ✅ Backend health check endpoint returns 200 OK at `http://localhost:8001/api/health`
- ✅ Database connection established with pgvector extension enabled
- ✅ Hot reload works in both Full Docker and Hybrid modes
- ✅ E2E test passes with Playwright validating full integration

## Business Value

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Decisions

**Monorepo Structure**:
```
bmadflow/
├── backend/          # Python FastAPI application
│   ├── app/
│   ├── alembic/
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── Dockerfile
├── frontend/         # React TypeScript application
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env.example
└── README.md
```

**Docker Compose Services**:
- `db` (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- `backend` (FastAPI)
- `frontend` (React + Vite)
- `pgadmin` (Database admin UI)

**Technology Stack** (from [Tech Stack](../architecture/tech-stack.md)):
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript 5.x+, Vite 5.x+, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI 0.110+, SQLAlchemy 2.x+, Alembic
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector (ankane/pgvector Docker image)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose

### Integration Points

**Frontend → Backend**:
- Frontend calls `http://localhost:8000/api/hello`
- CORS configured to allow `http://localhost:3000` origin

**Backend → Database**:
- SQLAlchemy async connection pool
- Connection string: `postgresql+asyncpg://bmadflow:password@db:5432/bmadflow`

**Developer → Docker Compose**:
- `docker-compose up` starts all services
- Volume mounts enable hot reload for both frontend and backend

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: Not required for Epic 1 (infrastructure setup)

**Integration Tests**:
- Backend health check endpoint test
- Database connectivity test

**E2E Tests**:
- Playwright MCP test: Navigate to http://localhost:3000, verify "Hello BMADFlow" message displayed
- Screenshot capture for validation

**Manual Testing**:
- Full Docker mode: `docker-compose up` → verify "Hello BMADFlow" in browser
- Hybrid mode: Start Docker services → Run backend locally → Run frontend locally → verify "Hello BMADFlow"

## Definition of Done ✅

- [x] All 6 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Full Docker mode working: `docker-compose up` displays "Hello BMADFlow"
- [x] Hybrid mode working: Local frontend/backend + Docker DB displays "Hello BMADFlow"
- [x] Backend health check endpoint returns 200 OK
- [x] PostgreSQL accessible via pgAdmin at http://localhost:5050
- [x] pgvector extension enabled and verified
- [x] Hot reload working in both deployment modes
- [x] README.md includes setup instructions for both modes
- [x] Playwright E2E test passes with screenshot captured
- [x] Code quality tools configured and passing (Black, Ruff, ESLint, Prettier)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Docker resource constraints | High | Medium | Provide Hybrid mode as alternative; document minimum Docker Desktop settings (4+ CPUs, 8GB RAM) |
| Port conflicts (5432, 8000, 3000, 5050) | Medium | Medium | All ports configurable via .env file; document conflict resolution |
| Ollama not installed/running | High | High | Clear error message on backend startup; document prerequisite in README |
| pgvector extension not available | High | Low | Use ankane/pgvector Docker image (includes extension pre-installed) |
| CORS issues between frontend/backend | Medium | Medium | Configure CORS middleware in Story 1.3; test in Story 1.6 |

## Story Sequence

**Sequential Dependencies**:
1. Story 1.1 (Monorepo) → Story 1.2 (Database) → Story 1.3 (Backend) → Story 1.4 (Frontend) → Story 1.5 (Docker Compose Full) → Story 1.6 (E2E Integration)

**Critical Path**:
- Story 1.2 must complete before Story 1.3 (backend needs database)
- Story 1.3 must complete before Story 1.6 (E2E needs backend endpoint)
- Story 1.4 must complete before Story 1.6 (E2E needs frontend)

**Parallelization Opportunities**:
- Stories 1.3 and 1.4 can be developed in parallel after Story 1.2 completes
- Story 1.5 can begin once Stories 1.3 and 1.4 are complete

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Level) ✅

1. **Full Docker Deployment**:
   - [x] Run `docker-compose up` successfully starts all 4 services (db, backend, frontend, pgadmin)
   - [x] Navigate to http://localhost:3002 displays "Hello BMADFlow" message (port from .env)
   - [x] Backend API at http://localhost:8001/api/hello returns `{"message": "Hello BMADFlow", "status": "ok"}`
   - [x] pgAdmin accessible at http://localhost:5050
   - [x] All services show healthy status: `docker-compose ps`

2. **Hybrid Deployment**:
   - [x] Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.hybrid.yml up -d` starts database and pgAdmin

   - [x] Run frontend locally: `npm run dev` starts successfully on port 3002
   - [x] Navigate to http://localhost:3002 displays "Hello BMADFlow" message

3. **Database Validation**:
   - [x] PostgreSQL container running and accessible
   - [x] pgvector extension enabled: `SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';` returns row
   - [x] Database persists data across container restarts (Docker volume working)

4. **Code Quality**:
   - [x] Backend: `black --check .` and `ruff check .` pass
   - [x] Frontend: `npm run lint` passes
   - [x] No linting errors in codebase

5. **Documentation**:

   - [x] README.md includes Hybrid deployment instructions
   - [x] README.md documents prerequisites (Docker, Python, Node.js, Ollama)
   - [x] .env.example file created with all required environment variables
   - [x] Startup scripts created (start_docker.sh, start_local.sh, stop_services.sh)

6. **Testing**:
   - [x] Playwright E2E test successfully captures screenshot of "Hello BMADFlow" page
   - [x] Backend health check endpoint returns 200 OK
   - [x] E2E test passes in 983ms validating full integration

## Notes

- This epic focuses on **infrastructure only** - no business logic implemented yet
- **Hot reload is critical** for developer experience - ensure volume mounts work correctly
- **Ollama prerequisite** must be clearly communicated - backend will fail to start without it in later epics (not required for Epic 1)
- **Port configurability** via .env prevents conflicts on developer machines
- **Playwright MCP integration** validates our E2E testing approach early

## Timeline Estimate

**Total Effort**: 12-24 hours (6 stories × 2-4 hours each)

**Story Breakdown**:
- Story 1.1: 2-3 hours
- Story 1.2: 2-3 hours
- Story 1.3: 2-4 hours
- Story 1.4: 2-4 hours
- Story 1.5: 2-3 hours
- Story 1.6: 2-4 hours

**Recommended Approach**: Complete sequentially to validate each layer before building the next
