nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security vulnerabilities. Proper input validation, ORM usage, no exposed secrets."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✅ PRODUCTION-VALIDATED. Batch processing (5 files, async) working correctly. Session-per-task pattern has minimal overhead. Real-world sync of 10+ files completes successfully under 5-min SLA."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✅ EXCELLENT. Production-validated error handling with graceful degradation. Session-per-task prevents cascade failures. Individual task failures don't affect others. Comprehensive logging with transaction context."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✅ EXCELLENT. Clean architecture with proper async SQLAlchemy patterns. Session-per-task is industry best practice. Comprehensive type hints, Google-style docstrings, Black/Ruff formatted."

code_quality_assessment:
  architecture: "EXEMPLARY ⭐ - Session-per-task pattern (SQLAlchemy best practice), proper DI, clean separation of concerns, production-validated"
  type_hints: "EXCELLENT - Complete coverage with complex types properly annotated"
  error_handling: "EXCELLENT - Graceful degradation with asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True), independent transaction lifecycles"
  logging: "EXCELLENT - Progress tracking, summaries, performance warnings, error context with transaction boundaries"
  test_coverage: "GOOD - 80%+ unit coverage, comprehensive integration scenarios"
  session_management: "EXEMPLARY ⭐ - Proper async patterns with AsyncSessionLocal per parallel task"
