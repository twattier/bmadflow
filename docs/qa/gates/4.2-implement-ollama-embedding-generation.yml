nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No hardcoded credentials, proper error sanitization, input validation via dimension checks'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Async implementation, configurable batching, retry with backoff prevents cascade failures. Integration test validates <10s for 100 chunks.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling, exponential backoff retry (3 attempts), graceful degradation with actionable error messages'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent: Google-style docstrings, type hints, 87% test coverage, clear separation of concerns'

notable_strengths:
  - 'Exceeded coverage target (87% vs 85% requirement)'
  - 'Robust error handling with actionable messages (e.g., "Run: ollama pull nomic-embed-text")'
  - 'Flexible model validation handling different Ollama response formats'
  - 'Integration tests properly skip when dependencies unavailable (pytest.mark.integration)'
  - 'Clean separation of concerns: validation, generation, batch processing'
  - 'Comprehensive retry strategy with exponential backoff prevents cascade failures'
