nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No vulnerabilities detected. XSS prevention via React auto-escaping and react-markdown. Input validation defensive (null checks, malformed source skipping). Authenticated API calls with proper error handling. No eval(), dangerouslySetInnerHTML, or unsafe navigation."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance for feature scope. Efficient rendering (re-render only on state change), React Query caching (no redundant API calls), lazy loading (document fetch on panel open), GPU-accelerated animations (CSS-based), minimal bundle impact (reused dependencies). Score: 95/100."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms. Document fetch failures show user-friendly errors. Null/missing sources handled gracefully. SSR/test environment guards present. React Query provides automatic retry. Graceful degradation for partial data (null anchors → scroll to top). Score: 95/100."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean, well-documented, maintainable codebase. Self-documenting code (clear names, descriptive logic). Full TypeScript coverage (no any types). Strategic code comments. Appropriate component sizes (MessageSourceLinks: 54 lines, SourcePanel: 142 lines). Comprehensive Dev Notes in story file. Score: 95/100."

test_architecture:
  component_tests:
    total: 20
    passing: 20
    failing: 0
    coverage_assessment: "EXCELLENT - Comprehensive coverage of MessageSourceLinks (10 tests) and SourcePanel (10 tests) with user-centric assertions, proper mocking, and edge case validation."
  integration_tests:
    total: 4
    passing: 4
    failing: 0
    coverage_assessment: "EXCELLENT - Full user flow validated (source click → panel open → document display → source switching → Open in Explorer)."
  test_quality:
    maintainability: "EXCELLENT - Clear test names, proper setup/teardown, reusable mock factories"
    execution_time: "FAST - 2.53s component, 3.19s integration (appropriate for CI/CD)"
    reliability: "EXCELLENT - 100% pass rate (24/24), no flaky tests, proper async handling (waitFor)"

    project_structure: PASS
    testing_strategy: PASS
    accessibility: PASS  # WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
  strengths:
    - "Complete AC coverage (8/8 implemented, tested, validated)"
    - "Test architecture: 24/24 tests passing (100% pass rate)"
    - "Type safety: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces"
    - "Defensive coding: SSR guards, malformed source validation, null checks"
    - "Accessibility: Semantic HTML, SheetDescription with sr-only for WCAG 2.1 AA"
    - "Code reuse: Effective reuse of MarkdownRenderer, useDocument hook, shadcn components"
    - "State management: Clean local state with previousSource tracking"
    - "Error handling: Comprehensive handling for null anchors, fetch failures, empty sources"
  improvements_completed:
    - "Backend file_name field added to sources_json (message_service.py:99)"
    - "Integration tests ALL PASSING (4/4 - previously 0/4)"
    - "SheetDescription added for accessibility (SourcePanel.tsx:99-102)"
    - "Black formatting applied to backend"
    - "All 24 tests passing with proper mocking"

risk_assessment:
  overall_risk_level: LOW
  probability: LOW
  impact: LOW
  mitigation_status: COMPLETE
  rationale: "All critical paths tested (source click → panel open → anchor scroll → close). Defensive coding applied (SSR guards, null checks, malformed source handling). Security validated (no XSS, injection risks, or unsafe navigation). Performance appropriate for feature scope. All previous concerns (integration test failures, missing file_name field, accessibility warnings) fully resolved."
