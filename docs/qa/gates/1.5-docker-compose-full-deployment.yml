    notes: 'Hot reload configured correctly, volume mounts optimized (node_modules exclusion), service startup order ensures db ready before backend.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Health checks implemented for db service, dependency chain ensures ordered startup, error handling via Alembic migrations and uvicorn.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent documentation in story Dev Notes, clear port configuration strategy, self-documenting Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml.'
