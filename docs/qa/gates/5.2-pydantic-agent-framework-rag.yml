  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'API keys properly stored in environment variables, not hardcoded. LLMProviderError custom exception prevents information leakage. No SQL injection risks (using ORM).'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Async/await throughout, retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 2-30s wait). Vector search limited to top_k=20 max. 60s timeout on LLM calls.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with specific exceptions. Graceful degradation when no chunks found. Structured logging for debugging. All external dependencies properly mocked in tests.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code organization with clear separation of concerns. Type hints on all functions. Google-style docstrings. Clean abstractions (BaseAgent, tool pattern). 92% test coverage.'
