# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "CORS configured, environment variables used, no credentials hardcoded. Auth/rate limiting deferred appropriately to Epic 2+."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "E2E test <1s, async/await used correctly, API responds in <20ms, Docker services responsive."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling implemented with loading/error states, Docker health checks configured, graceful degradation present."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code structure, TypeScript interfaces document contracts, comprehensive story documentation, clear separation of concerns."

# Test architecture assessment
test_architecture:
  coverage_level: GOOD
  test_design: EXCELLENT
  test_levels:
    e2e: "1 test covering full integration path (frontend→backend→DB)"
    integration: "Manual validation performed"
    unit: "Not required for POC - deferred to future work"
  test_data_strategy: "Deterministic (hello endpoint returns static message)"
  execution_reliability: EXCELLENT

# Code quality findings
code_quality:
  architecture: "Clean separation: API client → service layer → UI components"
  patterns: "FastAPI router pattern, React hooks, TypeScript interfaces"
  standards_compliance: "PEP-8 (Black/Ruff), ESLint/Prettier"
  refactoring_performed:
    - file: "frontend/tests/e2e/hello-bmadflow.spec.ts"
      change: "Commented out empty error test to resolve ESLint warning"
      impact: "Removed linting error, preserved TODO for future implementation"
