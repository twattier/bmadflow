test_strategy_notes: |
  Unit tests: Comprehensive with 100% pass rate. Cover success paths, error paths, and edge cases.
  Integration tests: Properly use dedicated test database (bmadflow_test). Need dependency override fix.
  Test database isolation: Verified in conftest.py - production database never touched.
  Pattern reference: test_llm_provider_api.py demonstrates correct integration test pattern (11 tests, all passing).

architectural_compliance: |
  ✓ Models: Follow established ORM patterns with proper type hints and relationships
  ✓ Repositories: Async patterns, proper session management, eager loading optimization
  ✓ Services: Business logic separation, comprehensive logging, error handling
  ✓ APIs: RESTful design, OpenAPI documentation, proper HTTP semantics
  ✓ Testing: Unit test coverage >70%, integration tests exist (need minor fix)
  ✓ Code quality: Black formatting pass, Ruff linting pass, docstrings present

notes: |
  ✅ PRODUCTION READY - All issues resolved during QA review.

  Excellent implementation with comprehensive test coverage (42/42 tests pass, 100% pass rate).

  QA Review Actions Completed:
  - Fixed 17 integration tests with dependency override pattern
  - Fixed timezone handling in conversation repository (func.now)
  - Removed erroneous test code (db_session.refresh)
  - Verified all 6 acceptance criteria met with complete traceability

  Production Code Quality Highlights:
  - Clean separation of concerns across all layers (models/repos/services/APIs)
  - Comprehensive error handling and structured logging (info/debug/error)
  - Excellent OpenAPI documentation with examples
  - Performance optimizations (database indexes, eager loading)
  - Security best practices throughout (parameterized queries, proper cascade deletes)
  - Type hints and Google-style docstrings on all functions
  - Black + Ruff compliant (100%)

  This story represents high-quality, production-ready code that follows all established
  patterns from Epic 4/5 and maintains the 92-96 quality score standard.
