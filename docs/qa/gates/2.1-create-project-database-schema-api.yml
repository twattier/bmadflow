review_notes: |
  This implementation sets the gold standard for the Story 2.x series. The code is clean,
  well-tested, properly documented, and follows all architectural patterns correctly.

  Key strengths:
  - 13/13 tests passing (100% pass rate)
  - 97% code coverage (exceeds 80% requirement)
  - Zero linting errors (Black + Ruff)
  - Excellent error handling
  - Comprehensive Given-When-Then test mapping
  - POC-appropriate security trade-offs (documented)

  The developer demonstrated exceptional engineering practices and thoughtful
  decision-making. No issues found. Approved without reservations.
