nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper input validation, error handling with clear messages, no security vulnerabilities identified. Content validation prevents empty/malformed input.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'HybridChunker configured with appropriate token limits (512 tokens). Async methods support non-blocking operations. Converter instances created per-call (could be optimized if needed).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks, clear ValueError exceptions for validation failures, proper logging at INFO and ERROR levels. Graceful handling of missing metadata fields.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code structure with Google-style docstrings, clear type hints, well-organized service layer. Code follows Black/Ruff standards. Adaptive implementation correctly handles Docling API limitations.'

  test_design_notes: |
    - Well-structured test fixtures using pytest patterns
    - Good use of asyncio markers for async method testing
    - Comprehensive assertions verifying both functionality and metadata
    - Tests validate Given-When-Then scenarios implicitly
    - Edge cases covered (empty content, unsupported types, indexing)
