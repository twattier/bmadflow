    title: "E2E test coverage at 33% (1/3 tests passing)"
    description: "Test 2 fails due to sync completing too fast for spinner assertion. Test 3 skipped due to missing error test data."
    refs:
      - "frontend/tests/e2e/sync-status-display.spec.ts:25-52"
      - "frontend/tests/e2e/sync-status-display.spec.ts:54-75"
    mitigation: "Component tests provide adequate coverage (10/10 passing). First E2E test proves full integration works. Not blocking for POC."

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No authentication/authorization in scope for UI display. GitHub API credentials handled in backend (Story 2.5). No sensitive data exposure in UI. XSS protection via React's auto-escaping. External links use rel='noopener noreferrer' for security."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "React Query caching prevents unnecessary API calls. Query invalidation triggers targeted refetch only. Component renders are optimized (no unnecessary re-renders). Relative time calculation is lightweight O(1). Loading states prevent blocking UI."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling in mutation hooks with type guards. Toast notifications inform users of success/failure. Loading states prevent race conditions. 10/10 component tests passing demonstrates reliability. E2E test proves full integration."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✅ RESOLVED: Type duplication removed - all files now import from central type definition using 'import type' syntax. Local state + mutation state pattern is intentional for immediate UI feedback (design decision, not technical debt). Overall architecture is clean with proper separation of concerns. Components are well-documented with TypeScript interfaces."
  accessibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All interactive elements properly labeled with data-testid. Button disabled states properly communicated. Tooltips provide additional context for error states. shadcn/ui components provide baseline WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Color is not the only indicator (text + icons used)."

# Recommendations for future enhancements
recommendations:

  future:
    - action: "Enhance E2E test to handle fast sync completion (use waitFor with assertion)"
      refs: ["frontend/tests/e2e/sync-status-display.spec.ts:25-52"]
      rationale: "Test 2 is timing-sensitive. Consider mocking API delay or using waitFor pattern."
    - action: "Add seed data for error scenarios to enable Test 3"
      refs: ["frontend/tests/e2e/sync-status-display.spec.ts:54-75"]
      rationale: "Currently skipped due to missing test data. Add ProjectDoc with unavailable GitHub URL."

# Active refactoring performed during review
refactoring:
  - title: "Centralized Playwright test artifacts"
    description: "Fixed Playwright config to centralize all test artifacts in frontend/tests/e2e/test-results/"
    files_changed:
      - "frontend/playwright.config.ts"
      - ".gitignore"
    cleanup:
      - "Removed scattered test-results/, playwright-report/, debug-screenshot.png from root and frontend/"
    rationale: "Prevents test artifacts from polluting repository. Improves project organization."

  - title: "Eliminated type duplication - Clean code achieved"
    description: "Removed all duplicated ProjectDocResponse interface definitions. All files now import from central type definition using TypeScript 'import type' syntax."
    files_changed:
      - "frontend/src/api/hooks/useProjectDocs.ts"
      - "frontend/src/components/common/SyncStatusBadge.tsx"
      - "frontend/src/features/projects/ProjectDocCard.tsx"
    verification:
      - "✅ All component tests passing (10/10)"
      - "✅ TypeScript compilation successful"
      - "✅ Production build successful"
      - "✅ Vite cache cleared and verified"
    rationale: "Eliminates maintenance burden of keeping 4 identical type definitions synchronized. Single source of truth for ProjectDocResponse type. Proper TypeScript type-only imports prevent runtime bloat."
