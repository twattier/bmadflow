reviewer_notes: |
  This implementation demonstrates exceptional engineering quality:

  Strengths:
  - Perfect separation of concerns (Repository → Service layers)
  - Comprehensive testing (21 tests, 100% service coverage)
  - Robust error handling with batch continuation
  - Complete type safety with docstrings
  - Idempotent design prevents duplicates
  - Production-ready code quality

  The developer (James) showed excellent judgement in:
  - Handling SQLAlchemy reserved keyword (metadata → doc_metadata)
  - Smart file type extraction with sensible defaults
  - Creating diverse integration test (12 file types)
  - Maintaining zero regressions (53 tests passing)

  No issues found. Ready for production deployment.
