gate: "CONCERNS"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. No auth/sensitive data handling. XSS protected by React. ORM prevents SQL injection."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "React.memo() optimization applied. Efficient eager loading with selectinload(). Limited to 10 conversations."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling via React Query. Empty states handled. Fallback for missing data. All 19 tests passing."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear component structure. Strong TypeScript typing. Comprehensive test coverage. Follows coding standards."

  - file: "frontend/src/features/chat/ConversationHistoryPanel.tsx"
    change: "Added SheetDescription component for accessibility compliance"
    why: "Radix UI Sheet requires description for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Test warnings indicated missing aria-describedby."
    how: "Imported SheetDescription, added with sr-only class for screen readers. Eliminates accessibility warnings in tests."
    impact: "Improved accessibility score. Zero test warnings after fix."
