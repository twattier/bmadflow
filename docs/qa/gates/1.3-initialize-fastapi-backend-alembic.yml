nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Environment variables properly externalized. No hardcoded secrets. CORS configured appropriately for POC. Pydantic validation provides fail-fast for missing config.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Async SQLAlchemy with connection pooling. Database query echo mode enabled for dev (acceptable for POC). Health endpoint uses efficient SELECT 1 query.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful error handling in health endpoint. Database connection failures handled without crashes. Async session management with proper context managers.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean code structure following layered architecture. All functions have docstrings. Black/Ruff compliant. Self-documenting code with clear separation of concerns.'
