# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Document content is properly handled through typed interfaces. XSS protection provided by react-markdown's safe rendering."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "AC9 requires <1 second rendering for typical BMAD docs. Implementation uses useMemo() for TOC parsing. Recommend manual performance testing with large documents before production."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling implemented. Loading states, error states, and null checks present throughout."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization, clear component separation, comprehensive tests, proper TypeScript typing. Code follows all standards."
