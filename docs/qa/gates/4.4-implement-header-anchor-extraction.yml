refactoring_performed:
  - file: "backend/app/utils/markdown_parser.py"
    change: "Improved character position tracking consistency"
    line: 111-131
    why: "Added explicit variable for stripped line to clarify that regex matches on stripped line while char_position uses original line length"
    how: "Extracted `stripped_line = line.rstrip()` to separate variable with explanatory comment"
    impact: "Improved code clarity and maintainability"
    tests_verified: "All 23 parser unit tests still pass"

acceptance_criteria_verification:
  ac1_header_identification:
    status: PASS
    tests: ["test_find_nearest_header_*", "test_process_markdown_extracts_anchors"]
    evidence: "8 unit tests for header mapping logic + integration tests with real docs"
  ac2_anchor_format:
    status: PASS
    tests: ["test_header_to_anchor_*", "test_header_anchor_format_validation"]
    evidence: "6 unit tests for anchor conversion + format validation in integration"
  ac3_database_storage:

    tests: ["ChunkProcessed schema", "DoclingService integration"]
    evidence: "header_anchor field present in all ChunkProcessed objects, flows to storage"
  ac4_graceful_fallback:
    status: PASS
    tests: ["test_process_markdown_no_headers", "test_chunk_before_header", "test_find_nearest_header_empty_anchor"]
    evidence: "3+ tests verify None anchor for content without headers"
  ac5_unit_tests:
    status: PASS
    tests: ["test_markdown_parser.py", "test_docling_service.py"]
    evidence: "42 total unit tests (23 parser + 19 service) with diverse markdown samples"
  ac6_integration_test:

    tests: ["test_process_prd_with_headers", "test_real_bmad_documentation"]
    evidence: "Real BMAD PRD processed: 31 unique anchors extracted from actual docs"

recommendations:
  immediate: []  # None - ready for production

  future:
    - action: "Consider upgrading to python-markdown AST parser for production"
      refs: ["backend/app/utils/markdown_parser.py"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current regex approach works well for POC. AST parser would be more robust for complex markdown edge cases in production."

    - action: "Add performance benchmark test for large documents (10,000+ lines)"
      refs: ["backend/tests/integration/test_header_anchor_extraction.py"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current tests use small-to-medium documents. Would be valuable to verify performance at scale."

notable_strengths:
  - "Outstanding test coverage: 100% on parser utility, 84% on service"
  - "Excellent documentation: All functions have Google-style docstrings with examples"
  - "Comprehensive edge case handling: Empty content, no headers, special characters, chunk before first header"
  - "Real-world validation: Integration test successfully processed actual BMAD documentation"
  - "Clean architecture: Proper separation between parsing logic and service integration"
  - "Type safety: 100% type hint coverage with proper Optional handling"
  - "Standards compliance: Black + Ruff verified, follows PEP 8"

dev_team_feedback:
  summary: "This is exemplary work. The implementation demonstrates professional software engineering practices with excellent test coverage, clear documentation, and thoughtful error handling. The refactoring I performed was minor (code clarity improvement only). Story is production-ready."

  strengths:
    - "Test design is exceptional - organized, comprehensive, isolated"
    - "Real integration test with actual project docs adds high confidence"
    - "Error handling is thorough and graceful"
    - "Code is self-documenting with excellent docstrings"

  learning_opportunities:
    - "Consider performance benchmarks for large documents in future stories"
    - "AST-based parsing could be explored for complex edge cases (production upgrade)"
