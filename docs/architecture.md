# BMADFlow Fullstack Architecture Document

> **Note**: This architecture document has been sharded into focused sections for easier navigation and maintenance. See the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) below for links to all sections.

## Document Overview

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **BMADFlow**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

**Context**: BMADFlow is a locally-deployed documentation hub for BMAD Method projects that provides:
- GitHub documentation synchronization with intelligent metadata extraction
- Visual file tree explorer with markdown/CSV/Mermaid rendering
- AI-powered RAG chatbot with source attribution and header anchor navigation
- Project and document management with sync status tracking
- Dashboard metrics and activity monitoring

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Code Examples Policy

> **MANDATORY READING**: All developers and AI agents MUST follow the [Code Examples Policy](architecture/code-examples-policy.md) when implementing features.
>
> **Key Rules:**
> 1. âœ… **Context docs are authoritative** - Implementation patterns in [docs/context/](context/) override architecture examples
> 2. âœ… **Check context docs first** - Before implementing, review relevant context documentation
> 3. âœ… **Use MCP services** - When context docs insufficient, use `context7` or `shadcn` MCP for latest patterns
> 4. âœ… **Maintain consistency** - All code examples in architecture MUST reference context docs
> 5. âœ… **Update context docs** - Document new patterns discovered during implementation
>
> **Violation of this policy leads to inconsistent codebase and architectural drift.**

## Quick Reference

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **Structure**: Monorepo with shared TypeScript types enabling type-safe frontend/backend communication
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite build tool, shadcn/ui Dashboard template
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) monolithic REST API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension (unified vector database for RAG)
- **RAG Pipeline**: Docling (document processing) â†’ Ollama API client (embeddings via localhost:11434) â†’ pgvector (storage/search)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose orchestration supporting Full Docker or Hybrid deployment modes
- **Testing**: Comprehensive pyramid with pytest (70%+ backend coverage), React Testing Library, Playwright (E2E)

### External Dependencies

- **Ollama Service**: Pre-existing Ollama instance at localhost:11434 with nomic-embed-text model (dim 768) - **NOT included in BMADFlow Docker Compose**
- **GitHub API**: Public repository access (unauthenticated initially)
- **LLM Providers**: Optional cloud LLM APIs (OpenAI, Google Gemini, LiteLLM) configured via environment variables

### Related Documentation

- **Requirements**: [docs/prd.md](prd.md) - 65 requirements (44 FR + 21 NFR), 36 stories across 6 epics
- **UX Design**: [docs/ux-specification.md](ux-specification.md) - User flows, component library, accessibility
- **Project Context**: [docs/brief.md](brief.md) - Business need, target users (3 users, ~10 projects)
- **Implementation Guides**: [docs/context/](context/) - Code examples, patterns, and best practices (see [Code Examples Policy](architecture/code-examples-policy.md) for usage rules)
